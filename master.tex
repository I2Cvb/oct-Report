This paper addresses the problem of automatic classification of \ac{sdoct} data for automatic identification of patients with \ac{dme} versus normal subjects.
Our method is based on \ac{lbp} features to describe the texture of \ac{oct} images and we compare different \ac{lbp} features extraction approaches to compute a single signature for the whole \ac{oct} volume.
Experimental results with two datasets of respectively 32 and 30 \ac{oct} volumes show that
regardless of using low or high level representations, features derived from \ac{lbp} texture have highly discriminative power.% for the task on hand.
 
Moreover, the experiments show that the proposed method achieves better classification performances than other recent published works.

\section{Conclusions}
The work presented here addresses the automatic classification of \ac{sdoct} data to identify subjects with \ac{dme} versus normal.
Based on the reported results, the low level volume 3D features and high level 2D features using patches achieve the most desirable results in the experimental setup presented here.
The comparison against different datasets and methodologies, highlights that:
regardless of using low or high level representations, volume signatures derived from \ac{lbp} texture show high discriminative power for distinguishing \ac{dme} vs normal volumes.

Due to the fact that breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among female population world-wide, any attempts to create tools for assisting radiologists during the diagnosis process are necessary.
However, most of the technologies developed in the imaging laboratories are expelled from this process because these technologies are not based on the existing findings and procedures undertaken by the clinicians.
To address this issue, and to develop \ac{cad} systems that take advantage of this clinical findings already adopted by clinicians, these systems only lack strategies to accurately delineate the breast structures and its lesions.

Therefore, this article proposes a highly modular and flexible framework for segmenting breast tissues and lesions present in \ac{bus} images using optimization strategies and high-level descriptors designed analogously to the visual cues used by radiologists.

\section{Conclusions}
This work presents a segmentation strategy to delineate lesions in \ac{bus} images using an optimization framework that takes advantage of all the facilities available when using \ac{ml} techniques.
Despite the limitation that the final segmentation is subject to the super-pixels' boundaries, the \ac{aov} results here reported are similar to those reported by other methodologies in the literature.
A higher \ac{aov} result can be achieved by refining the delineation resulting from our proposed framework by post-processing it with an \ac{acm}. In this manner the contour constraints could be applied to achieve a more natural delineation.

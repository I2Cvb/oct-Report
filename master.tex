Since breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among female population world-wide, any attempt to create tools for assisting radiologists during the process of diagnosing is necessary.
However, most of the technology developed in the imaging laboratories are expelled from this process by clinicians only because these technologies are not founded on the already existing clinical findings and procedures.
This article renders accurate delineation of the breast structures and lesions as the missing step for developing \ac{cad} systems that take advantage of the clinical findings already adopted by the clinicians.

Therefore, a highly modular and flexible framework for segmenting breast tissues and lesions present in \ac{bus} images using optimization strategies and high-level descriptors designed analogously to the visual cues used by radiologists is here proposed.

\section{Conclusions}
This work presents a segmentation strategy to delineate lesions in \ac{bus} images using an optimization framework that takes advantage of all the facilities available when using \ac{ml} techniques.
Despite the limitation that the final segmentation is subject to the super-pixels' boundaries, the \ac{aov} results here reported are similar to those reported by other methodologies in the literature.
A higher \ac{aov} result can be achieved by deforming the delineation resulting from the proposed framework using this to initialize a second post-processing step based on \ac{acm}. In this manner the contour constrains could be applied to achieve a more natural delineation.

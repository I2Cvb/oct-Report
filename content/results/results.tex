\section{Method evaluation and comparison} 
A 16 \ac{bus} images dataset with accompanying multi-label \ac{gt} delineating all the structures present in the images has been used to evaluate the proposed methodology for lesion segmentation application.
Every image in the dataset presents a single lesion with variable extension. 
The size of the lesions ranges from under $1/100$ to over $1/5$ of the image.
The dataset composed of cysts, \acp{fa}, \acp{dic} and \acp{ilc}.

\Cref{fig:results} shows qualitative results, whereas the quantitative results from the best configuration are reported as a table in \cref{fig:surveyResults:method}. %~\cite{massich2013phd}.
Notice that for the proposed framework, the performance in terms of \ac{aov} is limited by the capacity of the super-pixels to snap the desired boundary.
\Cref{fig:results} shows how the delineation resulting from a proper labeling of the super-pixels differs from the \ac{gt}.
%Despite the fact that a \ac{fpr} of $0.4$ seems significant, based on our experiments most of the images produce no \ac{fp} lesions.
%However, images with \ac{fp} lesions, are likely to produce more several of them as shown in \cref{fig:results}c-e.
%The amount of \ac{fp} lesions can be trimmed by applying a higher cost in the pairwise therm (compare \cref{fig:resuts:smallPWterm} and \cref{fig:results:bigPWterm}.
%Nevertheless, a severe increasing of the pairwise cost also increases the \ac{fnr} since some lesions are missed due to over-smoothing. %~\cite{massich2013phd}.
%The situation of having a larger \ac{fnr} is less desirable than reducing the \ac{fpr}. 
%The \ac{fnr} reported in \cref{fig:surveyResults:method} is caused by an image within the dataset that its lesion is fully contained in a single super-pixel and still around $20\%$ of this super-pixel's area is healty tissue.

Due to the lack of publicly available data (and code) there is no manner to perform a methodology comparison further than compiling the results reported in the literature.
\Cref{fig:surveyResults} resumes some of the methodologies found in the literature and traslates the reported results into \ac{aov} for comparison purposes.
%compiles relevant metholodologies relevant methodologies found in the literature 
%The table in \Cref{fig:surveyResults:survey} complies the evaluation reported by the authors of the most relevant methodologies found in the literature. %~\cite{massich2013phd}.
%Details about the methodologies proposed in the literature can also be found in the aforesaid table.
%Specifically it is detailed the category of technique been used for detecting the lesions, segmenting it and post-process the delineations (if any).
%The studied categories are: \ac{ml}, \ac{acm} and others.
The iconography used in \cref{fig:surveyResults:survey} relates methodology stages, technology used and if the stages have been treated separately or as a single stage.
%if the those stages are treated as independent and connected in a daisy-chain fashion, or otherwise the stages are addressed in an atomic manner.

\Cref{fig:surveyResults:comparison} arrenge the information for direct visual comparison.
%\Cref{fig:surveyResults:comparison} renders the information present in \cref{fig:surveyResults:survey} and \cref{fig:surveyResults:method} in a visual manner compare all the results at once.
%The methodologies arranged in a radial fashion and grouped by its most representative technology category. 
%In red it can be found a small, medium and large categorization of the dataset reported for testing.
%The concentric circles represent \ac{aov}. 
%The blue line correspond to the \ac{aov} results reported in the literature, whereas the black line indicates the \ac{aov} our framework scored in our testing.
An extra element is also represented in \cref{fig:surveyResults:comparison} as blue swatch delimited by two blue dashed lines.
The boundaries of this swatch correspond to performance of expert radiologists in terms of \ac{aov} based on an inter- and intra-observer experiment carried out by Pons et al.~\cite{gerard2013}.
%\footnote{The dataset used for testing the framework here proposed corresponds to the subset of images used by Pons et al.~\cite{gerard2013} that have accompanying multi-labelled \ac{gt}.}.

When comparing the results it is clear the inconvenience of unexciting public data, since several of the results outperform the manual delineations studied in~\cite{gerard2013}.
It can also be seen that the category tested in larger datasets is \ac{ml}, whereas \ac{acm} lead to better segmentations since the lesion boundary is easier to model in \ac{acm} compared to \ac{ml} based techniques.
